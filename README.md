Hey guys Jose speaking. This is my first ever plugin done while following along 
"The Complete Beginner's Guide to Audio Plug-in Development by Matthijs Hollemans.

It is a simple delay with feedback and filtering for the Feedback with
independent dry/wet knobs, Out gain, Tempy Sync / milliseconds option
and custom Bypass.

It was done 100% reading the book, I would for sure recommend it for anyone
interested on learning about audio plugin development or audio
programming.

Here's the Google Drive Link to Download the .vst3 file:

You might have problems on mac reading that since it is not signed,
you will find all the code in the repo to build it yourself anyway.
